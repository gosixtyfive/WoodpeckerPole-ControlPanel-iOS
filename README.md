# WoodpeckerPole-ControlPanel-iOS

This iOS iPad app has been developed to support the "Possibly the world's tallest Woodpecker Pole toy" exhibit for the 2017 Austin Maker Faire.

It demonstrates the use of CoreBluetooth and IoT remote control as a control panel for the robot which lifts the toy woodpecker to the top of the pole, launches the woodpecker downwards and then retrieves the woodpecker to repeat the cycle.
